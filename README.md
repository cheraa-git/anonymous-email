# Anonymous email chat
At the start user have to enter his name (without a password or anything else). Then the user gets to the main page, where he can send messages to other users.  All messages are stored in the database forever. This way, if someone uses the same name, they will see all the relevant messages. Messages are displayed immediately without refreshing the page.
